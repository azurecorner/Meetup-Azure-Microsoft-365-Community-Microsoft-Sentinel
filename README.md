** What is security information and event management (SIEM)?**

A SIEM system is a tool that an organization uses to collect, analyze, and perform security operations on its computer systems. Those systems can be hardware appliances, applications, or both.

In its simplest form, a SIEM system enables you to:

Collect and query logs.
Do some form of correlation or anomaly detection.
Create alerts and incidents based on your findings.
A SIEM system might offer functionality such as:

* Log management: The ability to collect, store, and query the log data from resources within your environment.
* Alerting: A proactive look inside the log data for potential security incidents and anomalies.
* Visualization: Graphs and dashboards that provide visual insights into your log data.
* Incident management: The ability to create, update, assign, and investigate incidents that have been identified.
* Querying data: A rich query language, similar to that for log management, that you can use to query and understand your data.

**What is Microsoft Sentinel?**
Microsoft Sentinel is a cloud-native SIEM system that a security operations team can use to:

* Get security insights across the enterprise by collecting data from virtually any source.
* Detect and investigate threats quickly by using built-in machine learning and Microsoft threat intelligence.
* Automate threat responses by using playbooks and by integrating Azure Logic Apps.
